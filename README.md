## Development Technologies

### Frontend
The frontend was created with **ReactJS** to enable a fast and enjoyable user experience. I used **Redux and Sagas** to create global states and asynchronous actions. The components was stylized using **Styled Components**.

### Backend
To serve a fast experience in the client-side is important to have great technologies working on backstage. Then, i idealized that **NodeJS**, **MongoDB** and **JSONWebToken** would be the ideal set. The power of Node allied to a strong NOSQL database like MongoDB helped me to create a solid backend for this application.
